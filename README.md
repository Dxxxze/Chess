To run the game: run Chess.java twice to open two window. Click on File -> New Game, first set one window as server, and the other as client. You can play Human vs Human, AI vs AI, or Human vs AI. 
To play it, just click on the piece you want to move to select, and click the desired destination to move. Click on the same piece again to unselect. If your destination is not reachable, it'll cancel the select and wait for you to select again. 

1. If you opened an empty board, try to go to Piece.java -> getImagePath(), remove [src/] from the path it returned. 
2. Our AI is very dumb, don't expect too much of it.  
3. We gave up on implementing draw, checkmate, and stalemate. 
4. Promotion is (mostly) working.
